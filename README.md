# Howdy, I'm Alex 👋😁 

I'm a full stack software engineer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React. I leverage my engineering and project management backgrounds to deconstruct complex problems and drive them to resolution.

When I'm not at the computer, I bake (usually tasty) cookies 🍪 and lift (not usually heavy) weights 🏋🏻‍♂.

Most recently, I built [Willow](https://willow-cdc.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted framework for creating log-based change data capture pipelines without requiring in-depth technical knowledge or expertise.

Read more about Willow [here](https://willow-cdc.github.io/)!

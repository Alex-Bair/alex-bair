# Howdy, I'm Alex üëãüòÅ 

I'm a full stack software engineer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React. I leverage my engineering and project management backgrounds to deconstruct complex problems and drive them to resolution.

What I love about software engineering:  
‚öô learning & using new technologies  
üß† applying deep technical knowledge to solve difficult problems  
ü§ù working on a team to build amazing applications

Most recently, I built [Willow](https://willow-cdc.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted framework for creating log-based change data capture pipelines without requiring in-depth technical knowledge or expertise.

Read more about Willow [here](https://willow-cdc.github.io/)!
